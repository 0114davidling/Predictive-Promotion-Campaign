# Predictive-Promotion-Campaign
QuickKits is a meal preparation and delivery service with nation-wide franchises.  From the QuickKits website, customers choose a recipe and place the order for all the ingredients, sourced and chopped. QuickKits has four main categories of recipes, namely Healthy, Vegetarian, Meaty, and Specialty.  Weekly meal plans are offered, with customers choosing from plans with two, three, four, or five meal deliveries per week. A delivery can consist of one or more meals.  QuickKits recently decided to test an upselling promotional discount.  On March 5, 2018, (2018/03/05), 10% percent of their customers on two-meal-per-week plans were offered a promotional discount of 40% for a three-meal-per-week plan, for two weeks.  As the contribution margin for this service is approximately 20%, the promotion will run at a loss. At the end of the two-week period, subscribers to the promotion would remain on the three-week plan at regular price unless they opted out.   

The first challenge is to build a predictive model of subscribers to the promotion, based on the 10% of customers that received the offer.  Second, utilizing your model and other information in the case to build a business recommendation plan to the managers of QuickKits on how to improve their business.
